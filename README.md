# floppy-linux

Slides + image for the 19. Sesja Linuksowa talk: "Can we boot Linux from just a floppy?"

## TO-DO

The process of creating this project was very chaotic and I have not yet found time to write down proper setup and build instructions.

```
% qemu-system-i386 -fda floppy-linux.img -enable-kvm -m 70
```
